# YewBot
Fully automated OSRS woodcutting bot with included banking functions. The banking portion will only work if you execute script in Southeast Falador as shown in images and video below. This script utilizes image detection in both opencv and pyautogui libraries. No third party clients, third party plugins, no bans :) 




**REQUIREMENTS**

- Python 3 (I am using version 3.10.9)

**HOW TO USE:**

1.) Launch the OSRS client and move your character near Yew tree in southeast Falador

2.) Open a terminal (cmd prompt or powershell)

3.) cd to the directory where you have the python script located

4.) Type the command: '**pip install -r requirements.txt**' to install all python reqs

5.) Resize your window to the expected dimensions by executing the "resize-window.py" script: **python3 resize-window.py**

5.) Execute woodcutting script by typing '**python3 YewBot.py**'

**NOTES**:

- Script must be executed in southeast Falador next to the Yew Tree in order for the banking part to function properly
