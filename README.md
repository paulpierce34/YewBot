# YewBot
Fully automated OSRS woodcutting bot with included banking functions. The banking portion will only work if you execute script in Southeast Falador as shown in images and video below. This script utilizes image detection in both opencv and pyautogui libraries. No third party clients, third party plugins, no bans :) 




**REQUIREMENTS**

- Python 3 (I am using version 3.10.9)

**HOW TO USE:**

1.) Launch the OSRS client and move your character near Yew tree in southeast Falador

2.) Open a terminal (cmd prompt or powershell)

3.) cd to the directory where you have the python script located (git clone https://github.com/paulpierce34/YewBot.git)

4.) Type the command: '**pip install -r requirements.txt**' to install all python reqs

5.) Resize your window to the expected dimensions by executing the "resize-window.py" script: **python3 resize-window.py**

5.) Execute woodcutting script by typing: **python3 YewBot.py**
